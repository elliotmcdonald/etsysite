            <p>Elliot McDonald is a South African-born artist who has made Barcelona his home. He studied fine arts at HKU in The Netherlands where he explored the intersection between machinery, artificial intelligence, and fine arts.

His pieces showcase a perfect balance between chaos and control, and it's this unique balance that has made his work so popular. Elliot's algorithmic drawings are a celebration of the creative power of technology and the infinite possibilities it holds. </p>
            <p>Elliot's work has been displayed in galleries across the world and has been met with critical acclaim. He is a true inspiration to anyone who believes in the power of creativity and the limitless possibilities it holds.</p>
